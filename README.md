# Alarm-System-Motion-Detector
Sample source code for PR14-Alarm System Motion Detector. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface PIR sensor and read its status for alarm system. PIR can be used to detect human motion. It demonstrates the method to interface PIR sensor with microcontroller.
Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/v9.8 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(.c), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80). Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
