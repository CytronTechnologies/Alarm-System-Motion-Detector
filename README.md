http://www.cytron.com.my/p-pr14.
Sample source code for PR14-Alarm System:Motion Detector. This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface PIR sensor and read its status for alarm system. PIR can be used to detect human motion. It demonstrates the method to interface PIR sensor with microcontroller.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(C and Hex file), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80)
